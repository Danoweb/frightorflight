Multiplayer VR horror experience

# Description

The multiplayer for Fright or Flight has two modes.  The first mode is the primary player, or what we like to call “The Victim”.  This character is charged with completing objectives (and bonuses) as quickly as possible.  This player is also the player wearing the Virtual Reality gear for an immersive experience.  The other players who join the game, who we like to call the “Catchers” are charged with interfering, or preventing the victim from finishing the objectives.  They have a varied arsenal at their disposal.  They can spawn creatures, triggers noises, adjust light levels, move objects, and generally effect the environment in any way possible to spook, scare, and downright terrorize the victim.  This is all down from a top down perspective or “God View” of the level.  This view allows the catchers to set triggers and events in multiple ways or even chain them together with other effects for a truly frightening experience for the Victim.
